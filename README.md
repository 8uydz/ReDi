# ReDi Final Project
## Created by Ta Huy Vo

### Thank you for visiting my ReDi School final project. Preparing and cleaning the data, training the pre-trained models, and evaluating the trained models are all done in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Topics covered by the project include:
  - File Processing
  - Requests, Modules

### There are 2 Kaggle datasets included in this project:
  - Stanford Dogs Dataset: contains over 20,000 images of 120 dog breeds. (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)
  - Cat Breeds Dataset: contains over 67.000 images of 67 different cat breeds as labeled by advertisers for adoption. (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset) (Notice: In my working experiment, I decided to remove 12 breeds from the dataset because they each had fewer than 40 images which could lead to the models being Underfit and therefore less accurate.)

### The ConvNext family is the foundation for the Models I used. (Source: https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/tree/main)

### Colab was used to create this project.
